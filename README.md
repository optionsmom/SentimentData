# Project Proposal
Team Crypto-Kick Ass has decided to understand how sentiment can possibly drive price of a select group of Crypto Currencies and if that sentiment 
can be programmed into an algorithmic trading model to produce succesful returns.  Furthermore, we will have a progammed chat bot to answer questions
so we don't have to.
